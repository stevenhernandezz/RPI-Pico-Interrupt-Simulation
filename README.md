# RPI-Pico-Interrupt-Simulation
This project uses the RPI Pico simulation to gain familiarty with ARM CortexMO+ interrupt systems and utilize RPI Pico SDK to handle interrupts. 


## Description
This project contains a C++ program from the Raspberry Pi Pico that sets up a GPIO pin to trigger an interrupt on both rising and falling edges. When that interrupt is called, my program will output a human-readable message indicating the type of GPIO event that occurred either “Rising-Edge” or “Falling Edge”.
